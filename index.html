        <h1>Designing Dreams with Code</h1>       
    <article>
        <p>Welcome to the story of Lucky, a young boy with a passion for technology and a dream to become not just web developer but also a software developer. Follow his journey as he navigates the challenges of learning to code and discovers the power of creativity in the digital world.        
        </p>
        <p>the fact that I chose to start a python coding journey on the 1st of January 2023. After a 2-day session in that area, I felt that I wasn’t built for such space.
        I had to think through it through the year but found no conviction. I had to meet someone who already has been established to talk me through everything I could possibly need and also gain a bit of sympathy. It all led to disappointment. Although my motive at that time wasn’t really encouraged or would I say satisfactory to him I was told to halt the entire process.
        Fast forward to 2024, I happened to have met the individual teaching a set of individuals. It did hurt my feeling, making me think if I was good enough to learn under him or generally wasn’t still built for a space in the tech world so I had to move to on. 
        During the midyear, I had travelled for an industrial training. Towards the end of the training, I stumbled upon the Learnable 24 Internship program by Genesys on Instagram.
        It was so funny because at that time I couldn’t apply due to insufficient fund in my account. I thank God for the provision; I later applied through the 50% scholarship waiver by CrispTV. 
        When the program started, I didn’t have the resources like laptop and even a phone to start properly with others. At the long run, lectures in school had started becoming really intensive that I couldn’t cope continuing the program so I decided to sacrifice my learnable program.
        Well, it didn’t end there I continued to strive and look for help. I had to speak to my guy again but on this note concerning laptop only which he later came through for me.
        Few months after that period I learnt about the Upskill 25 cohort 1 on Instagram. I applied for the program and received a rejection email. That was when I thought the universe was fighting against my progress in life. I reviewed the reason why I got the rejection and it was because I was so honest about the state I was at the moment. I was still lacking a phone and trust me there was no way I could even stay consistently for online meetings during the course of the program. Another issue was power instability, as the area where I live had an issue with their transformer. In that state, there was a new one but the installation became a prayer point as the engineers and those sponsoring the process became reluctant. There again I thought for real that really the universe was against my tech life.<br>Right now, now I can say that I am living my dream.
